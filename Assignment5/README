Notes:
	Deserialization and Rollback were unable to be finished ontime; couldn't figure out a proper way of implementing them from my conceptual idea of how to.
	
Bugs:
	-Serialization of Advisee Lists sometimes segfaults when transfering over to file.
	-Rarley node deletions can fail to enforce referntial integrity and throw off both tree's syncronization, noted cases tend to involve deleteing
	 faculty with multiple advisees  and transfering said advisee's to another faculty with existing advisees.
