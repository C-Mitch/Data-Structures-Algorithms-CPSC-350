Bugs:
	A Bug in the Student class pertaining to getting/setting wait times for Student objects.  Function Student::setWaitTime(int tick) will correctly
	set the accurate wait time for the given Student, but will either not store the calculated value or return the Student Constructor initialized value
	(waitTime = 0) when Function Student::getWaitTime() is called.  This may be a sideeffect of the process by which the Student objects were created.
	
	DLL contains(T value) and remove(T key) required overridng the default == operator, which I didn't feel was necessary for this assignment
	since niether functions were going to be used, so the portions of the functions that were causing this error were commented out for the time being.
