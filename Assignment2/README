Notes:
My sincerest apologies for the procedurally generated spaghetti code that is this project; personally I blame the poor chlorine ventilation at SCIACS for 
half of the design choices...such as making a boarder around the array for both Mirror and Doughnut Mode to check their neighbor conditions. In 
retrospect, using modular division probably would have been more efficient/easier, but then we don't get those fancy boarders or 
amazing (soul destroying) print statement debugging...so yeah...

please forward all grievances to Coach Dennis Ploessel @ dploesse@chapman.edu 

Bugs:
	-The isStable() conditional checker (Assignment2Driver 155) works by comparing the total number of alive cells across a 1 generation gap
	 (e.g. total alive Gen 3 == total alive Gen 5).  The logic behind this is if a board can't produce a new outcome with a gap of 1 generation,
	 it must be flipping between it's previous and current outcomes perpetually, and thus is "stable".  However, since isStable() only check the 
	 total number of alive cells between generations, it's possible it could false-positive a new, unique outcome should it happen to have the same 
	 number of alive cells as the generation its being compared too (GenCurrent-2).  It's unlikely to happen, but could.
	-Honestly I wasn't too sure how Mirror Mode Rules were enforced; my understanding lead me to believe only the four corners could have 3 reflection neighbors,
	 while everything else could only have one; unlike dougnut mode, in which case EVERY cell would have 3 reflective neighbors.
	-A lot of the input error checking heavily relies on the assumption people follow the right formatting they are told; needless to say, most still
	 probably wont and I didn't have enough time to handle those exceptions.
	-Many more things I can't even begin to imagine.
